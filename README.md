[![Build](https://github.com/KFKMan/MatrixDeterminantCalculator/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/KFKMan/MatrixDeterminantCalculator/actions/workflows/cmake-multi-platform.yml)

İstanbul Gelişim University Computer Engineering First Year First Semester Final Project.

It's a user-given 2D Square (NxN) Matrix Determinant Calculator in C with C90 support.

Supported algorithms [Cofactor Expansin (Laplace Expansion)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_expansion),[ Leibniz Formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_determinants), [Row Reduction (Gaussian Elimination)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_elimination)

Note: it's not have the best implementations.

**REQUIRETMENTS**

It's pure C code without any other library (only standart libraries) dependency.

As default there is a CMake configuration providen but you don't limited to use that, this steps is for who want to use providen configuration.

1- Install CMake: You can install it from (cmake.org)

2- Install Supported CMake Tool like Ninja (ninja-build.org) and configure it: For Ninja there's two option you have you can install pre-compiled binary and add it to CMake Path or you can build from source (you can use install-ninja-source.bat, note: install-ninja-source.bat need git).
